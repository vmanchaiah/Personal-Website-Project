                <h3> Information About Award</h3>
                <p> The Congressional Award had various levels that you can work towards.
                There are four program areas in which you must work towards: voluntary 
                service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition/
                exploration. You must meet the program-requirements for each of the 
                four different areas to earn the award. 
                </p>

                <h3> Work Done for Award</h3> 
                 <p> For this award I got volunteer hours from volunteering at 
                     various places in my community such as the school and the 
                     local food pantry. For personal development I worked to improve
                     my violin skills by using target practice. For physical fitness
                     I trained for and successfully ran a 10k. For my expedition I 
                     planned a trip to Oklahoma City where I explored the city and
                     all it has to offer.

                <h3> Information About Award</h3>
                <p> The Presidential Volunteer Service Award is an award
                    that is given to those who volunteer a certain number
                    of hours in their community
                </p>

                <h3> Work Done for Award</h3> 
                <p> For this award I volunteered over a hundred hours in my 
                    community at events such as Christmas in Springboro, Oktoberfest,
                    Boro Fest, and many more. I also received a large amount of volunteer
                    hours working towards my gold award project. I was validated by the 
                    Girl Scouts organization.

                <h3> Information About Award</h3>
                <p> The Girl Scouts Gold Award is awarded to those who tackle an 
                    issue in their community. The project needs to sustainable even
                    after the project is completed by the Girl Scout. She must show
                    leadership and work with the members of the community.
                </p>

                <h3> Work Done for Award</h3>
                <p> For this award I set up a lending library at my local food
                    pantry. I collected books from people in the community and
                    got old books from local libraries. I wanted to find an easy
                    way for the people who did not have enough time to visit the 
                    library have access to books.
